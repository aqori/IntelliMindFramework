# IntelliMindFramework

## Description

A hybrid neural architecture search framework integrating differentiable architecture search with Bayesian optimization, featuring hierarchical graph-based neural representations and adaptive resource allocation for efficient AI model design.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the IntelliMindFramework software project:
- "Utilizes neural networkbased clustering algorithms to identify hidden patterns in user behavior",
- "Provides realtime sentiment analysis through natural language processing of user feedback",
- "Integrates with popular deep learning frameworks to enable custom model deployment",
- "Supports data augmentation techniques to reduce overfitting and improve model accuracy",
- "Includes explainable AI (XAI) tools to provide insights into model decisionmaking processes",
- "Offers automated feature engineering through recursive feature elimination",
- "Implements robust anomaly detection using oneclass SVM and local outlier factor algorithms"
- Let me know if you need any changes!
